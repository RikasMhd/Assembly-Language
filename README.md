An Assembly Language Program (ALP) is a low-level program written using mnemonics that directly correspond to machine instructions of a specific processor (like 8086, x86, ARM).Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is close to hardware.
Each instruction performs a single CPU operation.
🔹 It is processor dependent
🔹 Faster execution
🔹 Used in embedded systems, OS, device drivers
